## Introduction

Welcome to the backend repository of the KnowShare project. KnowShare is a dynamic social media platform designed for sharing knowledge and expertise. This README provides essential information for setting up, configuring, and understanding the backend of the application.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js and Express.js for building the server and handling API requests.
- MongoDB as the database for storing user data and content information.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) for payment integration.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization.
- Other Node.js libraries and middleware as necessary.

## Getting Started
